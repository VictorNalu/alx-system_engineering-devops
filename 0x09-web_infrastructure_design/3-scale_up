## Explanation
Server 1:
Hosts the web server component.
Responsible for serving web content to clients.

Server 2:
Hosts the application server component.
Responsible for executing the business logic of the application.

Server 3:
Hosts the database component.
Stores and manages the application data.

Load Balancer (HAProxy):
Configured as a cluster with another load balancer for high availability.
Distributes incoming traffic across the web server and application server components for load balancing and redundancy.

### Explanation:

Web Server Component:
Separating the web server component allows for specialized configuration and optimization for serving static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) to clients.

Application Server Component:
Separating the application server component allows for dedicated execution of the application's business logic and processing dynamic requests from clients.

Database Component:
Separating the database component ensures data isolation and dedicated resources for storing and managing application data, enhancing data security and performance.

Load Balancer (HAProxy):
The load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers hosting the web and application components, improving performance, scalability, and fault tolerance.
Configuring HAProxy as a cluster with another load balancer ensures high availability by providing redundancy and failover capabilities. If one load balancer fails, the other one can continue serving traffic seamlessly.
This infrastructure design achieves a scalable, fault-tolerant, and high-performing architecture by distributing components across multiple servers and utilizing load balancing for traffic distribution and redundancy.
