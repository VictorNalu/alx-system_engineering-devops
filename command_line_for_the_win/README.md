## Tasks

********************

This is how I used SFTP to move the images from my local machine:

1. I went to the Intranet sandbox and run the ubuntu sandbox, I copied the SFTP link and ran it on my VSCODE terminal. It requested for password,
	then, I copied the paasword there on the intranet sandox and pasted it.

2. I created the directories.

3. Then, I used the 'put' command to move the images from my local machine to the remote server.

4. I also installed a VSCODE SFTP extension that I could use to view the files in the directory in real time.
